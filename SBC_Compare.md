# Compare Pocket Computers:

I looked at Raspberry Pi, which is essentially the competing single board computer. It had me seriously wondering but then I revisited the Beagle.org page and saw/realized there is a new one: BeagleBone AI. Key advantages of the Beagle system:
BeagleBone Black (= BBB, it's what I showed you) is lighter and less power hungry. There's no free lunch, MIPS cost Watts.
- If BBB isn't good enough, there is BeagleBone AI. 
- A cape I do would be pin compatible (!!) to the extent they share the peripheral features.
- Beagle is open source. Raspberry is proprietary. There is no Raspberry schematic. 
- Raspberry has a great beginner's guide. Nicely done, but for kids, which is the target audience. Kids of all ages, nothing wrong with that.
- BBB and BBAI have a PRU, real-time processor.
- The BBAI has an AM5729 processor which is just ridiculous. The datasheet is > 4k pages...
- Tradeoff the MIPS vs Watts. No free lunch, powerful processors need to be supplied with more power.
