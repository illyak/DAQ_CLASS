- **Exploring BeagleBone: Tools and Techniques for Building with Embedded Linux, Derek Molloy, 2nd Edition**
    - Very excellent and relevant book, might even make a good class textbook: https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-BeagleBone-Techniques-Building-Embedded/dp/1119533163/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=derek+molloy&qid=1581087485&sr=8-1
- **Real World Instrumentation with Python: Automated Data Acquisition and Control Systems, J M Hughes** 
    - Decent general read if you are completely new to the lab bench environment. It is rather dated material with an excess of real basic fundamentals taking the place of what you were actually expecting to be reading about based on the title: https://www.amazon.com/RealWorldInstrumentationPythonAcquisition/dp/0596809565/ref=sr_1_1crid=2YAI68J0HYH68&keywords=real+world+instrumentation+with+python&qid=1581087562&sprefix=python+instrument%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-1

- Some class at Cambridge, England is also doing something relevant. They apparently running Notebook on the Beagle using FreeBSD OS: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1617/L41/2016-2017-l41-labsetup.pdf
