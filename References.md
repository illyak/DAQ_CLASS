- **Exploring BeagleBone: Tools and Techniques for Building with Embedded Linux, Derek Molloy, 2nd Edition**
    - Very excellent and relevant book, might even make a good class textbook: https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-BeagleBone-Techniques-Building-Embedded/dp/1119533163/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=derek+molloy&qid=1581087485&sr=8-1
- **Learning BeagleBone Python Programming: Unleash the potential of BeagleBone using Python, Alexander Haim** 
    - Good and relevant: https://www.amazon.com/Learning-BeagleBone-Python-Programming-Alexander/dp/1784399701/ref=pd_rhf_ee_p_img_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=KMKVYANBN3NKED99XZK9
- **Real World Instrumentation with Python: Automated Data Acquisition and Control Systems, J M Hughes** 
    - Decent general read if you are completely new to the lab bench environment. It is rather dated (seemingly from the day it was published) and an excess of real basic fundamentals taking the place of what you were actually expecting to be reading about based on the title: https://www.amazon.com/RealWorldInstrumentationPythonAcquisition/dp/0596809565/ref=sr_1_1crid=2YAI68J0HYH68&keywords=real+world+instrumentation+with+python&qid=1581087562&sprefix=python+instrument%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-1

- Looks like these guys are doing something similar but can't make out the details of their class or extended school project: https://guitar.ucsd.edu/beaglebone/index.php/Completed_Tasks
- Some class at Cambridge, England is also doing something relevant. They apparently running Notebook on the Beagle using FreeBSD OS: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1617/L41/2016-2017-l41-labsetup.pdf
