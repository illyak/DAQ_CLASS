- **Exploring BeagleBone: Tools and Techniques for Building with Embedded Linux, Derek Molloy, 2nd Edition**
    - Very relevant book, might even make a good class textbook: https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-BeagleBone-Techniques-Building-Embedded/dp/1119533163/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=derek+molloy&qid=1581087485&sr=8-1
- **Real World Instrumentation with Python: Automated Data Acquisition and Control Systems, J M Hughes** 
    - Don't let this seemling perfectly applicable title fool you, it's not very useful. It is some antiquated stuff, also written with an excess of fundamental physics which fills the book with lots of irrelevant material at the expense of the content you were expecting. Note the glowing review... apparently written by a friend... : https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Instrumentation-Python-Acquisition/dp/0596809565/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YAI68J0HYH68&keywords=real+world+instrumentation+with+python&qid=1581087562&sprefix=python+instrument%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-1

- Some class at Cambridge, England is also doing something relevant, apparently running Notebook on the Beagle using FreeBSD OS: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1617/L41/2016-2017-l41-labsetup.pdf
