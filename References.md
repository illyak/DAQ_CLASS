- **Exploring BeagleBone: Tools and Techniques for Building with Embedded Linux, Derek Molloy, 2nd Edition**
    - Very relevant book, might even make a good class textbook: https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-BeagleBone-Techniques-Building-Embedded/dp/1119533163/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=derek+molloy&qid=1581087485&sr=8-1
- **Real World Instrumentation with Python: Automated Data Acquisition and Control Systems, J M Hughes** 
    - Good general read, but not very useful in practice since it is antiquated stuff: "... When serial interfaces are mentioned, most people will think of RS-232, or perhaps RS-485." (p.547). https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Instrumentation-Python-Acquisition/dp/0596809565/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YAI68J0HYH68&keywords=real+world+instrumentation+with+python&qid=1581087562&sprefix=python+instrument%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-1

- Looks like these guys are doing something similar but can't make out the details of the class: https://guitar.ucsd.edu/beaglebone/index.php/Completed_Tasks
- Some class at Cambridge, England is also doing something relevant, apparently running Notebook on the Beagle using FreeBSD OS: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1617/L41/2016-2017-l41-labsetup.pdf
