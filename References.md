Books:
---
- **Exploring BeagleBone: Tools and Techniques for Building with Embedded Linux, Derek Molloy, 2nd Edition**
    - Very excellent and relevant book, might even make a good class textbook. If you get, or look at, only one book, this is the one: <br> 
    https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-BeagleBone-Techniques-Building-Embedded/dp/1119533163/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=derek+molloy&qid=1581087485&sr=8-1
- **Learning BeagleBone Python Programming: Unleash the potential of BeagleBone using Python, Alexander Haim** 
    - Good and relevant: <br> 
    https://www.amazon.com/Learning-BeagleBone-Python-Programming-Alexander/dp/1784399701/ref=pd_rhf_ee_p_img_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=KMKVYANBN3NKED99XZK9
- **Real World Instrumentation with Python: Automated Data Acquisition and Control Systems, J M Hughes** 
    - This is more of a general lab tutorial which just brushes over Python while making a sweeping survey of seemingly everything starting right from the Bohr model of the atom but then chokes at fullfilling the promise of the book's title. The guys giving the great book reviews have probably never set foot in a lab. Still, it's all stuff you need to know and here it is written in an accessable style: <br> https://www.amazon.com/RealWorldInstrumentationPythonAcquisition/dp/0596809565/ref=sr_1_1crid=2YAI68J0HYH68&keywords=real+world+instrumentation+with+python&qid=1581087562&sprefix=python+instrument%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-1
- **Getting Started with BeagleBone, Matt Richardson**
    - Very much a "maker" type of book. No real theory. OK to get the basics, but in its ~ 125 pages it doesn't, and can't be expected to, cover that much. Rather get the Derek Malloy book, if you're serious: <br>
https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-BeagleBone-Linux-Powered-Electronic/dp/1449345379
- **Embedded Linux Primer, Christopher Hallinan, 2nd Edition**
    - This is a decent primer, as the name suggests. Next step is pretty much grabbing the data manual of the particular processor on hand, however many thousands of pages that is, and diving into the abyss: <br>
https://www.amazon.com/Embedded-Linux-Primer-Practical-Real-World/dp/0137017839/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16ZN13G6HC46O&dchild=1&keywords=embedded+linux+primer&qid=1584923666&s=books&sprefix=embedded+linux%2Cstripbooks%2C250&sr=1-3
- **The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python, Reitz & Schlusser**
    - This is a compendium of tips and links to more info: <br>
https://www.amazon.com/Hitchhikers-Guide-Python-Practices-Development/dp/1491933178/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=the+Hitchhiker%27s+Guide+to+Python&qid=1584923908&s=books&sr=1-2
- **A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python, Hans Petter Langtangen, 5th Edition**
    - The edition number might tell you something. This is a wonderful book, even a great bedside reader. Wish I had a class with this as the textbook. It is simply a well-done hardcover book and worth the price from Springer publishers: <br>
https://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Programming-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3662498863/ref=sr_1_2?crid=RFZ8I5O6R7JY&dchild=1&keywords=a+primer+on+scientific+programming+with+python&qid=1584924227&s=books&sprefix=a+primer+on+scientif%2Cstripbooks%2C257&sr=1-2
- **Fluent Python, Luciano Ramalho**
    - A book of more advanced topics, picking up where primers leave off, and giving your code some spit-shine: <br>
https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1XNZUQFYMSQ18&dchild=1&keywords=fluent+python&qid=1584924454&s=books&sprefix=fluent%2Cstripbooks%2C257&sr=1-2

- Some class at Cambridge, England is also doing something relevant. They are apparently running Notebook on the Beagle using FreeBSD OS: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1617/L41/2016-2017-l41-labsetup.pdf
