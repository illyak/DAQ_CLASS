- **Exploring BeagleBone: Tools and Techniques for Building with Embedded Linux, Derek Molloy, 2nd Edition**
    - Very excellent and relevant book, might even make a good class textbook: <br> 
    https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-BeagleBone-Techniques-Building-Embedded/dp/1119533163/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=derek+molloy&qid=1581087485&sr=8-1
- **Learning BeagleBone Python Programming: Unleash the potential of BeagleBone using Python, Alexander Haim** 
    - Good and relevant: <br> 
    https://www.amazon.com/Learning-BeagleBone-Python-Programming-Alexander/dp/1784399701/ref=pd_rhf_ee_p_img_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=KMKVYANBN3NKED99XZK9
- **Real World Instrumentation with Python: Automated Data Acquisition and Control Systems, J M Hughes** 
    - This is more of a general lab tutorial which just brushes over Python while making a sweeping survey of seemingly everything and then falls short at what the title of the book originally claimed. The guys giving the great book reviews have probably never set foot in a lab. Still, it's all stuff you need to know and here it is written in an accessable style: <br> https://www.amazon.com/RealWorldInstrumentationPythonAcquisition/dp/0596809565/ref=sr_1_1crid=2YAI68J0HYH68&keywords=real+world+instrumentation+with+python&qid=1581087562&sprefix=python+instrument%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-1

- Looks like these guys are doing something similar but can't make out the details of their class or extended school project: https://guitar.ucsd.edu/beaglebone/index.php/Completed_Tasks
- Some class at Cambridge, England is also doing something relevant. They apparently running Notebook on the Beagle using FreeBSD OS: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1617/L41/2016-2017-l41-labsetup.pdf
