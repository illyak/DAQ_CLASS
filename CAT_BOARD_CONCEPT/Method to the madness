Seemingly nothing to do with IT at the moment but hang on... This is the alternative to using the gear in the lab there, I make my own. Not as nicely packaged but the DAQ concepts are all the same. This has a few advantages in portability, conceptual simplicity but also the full-cycle of building a DAQ application start to finish.

The free board layout software I tried, KiCAD: https://kicad-pcb.org/    works quite well enough to get this kind of stuff done. I made a little coupon board for work and sent it out today. Typical turnaround takes about a week and the blank boards come back which you then solder the parts to. 

With the parts soldered in place, that FTDI cable (see datasheet here attached) talks to all of them via the I2C serial protocol which you write from Jupyter (or MATLAB, LabVIEW, etc). I do this frequently. It works dandy.

So a finished notebook could be a temperature strip chart, reading that TMP100 sensor (U5 on the schematic) and updating a chart running in Jupyter.  Put your finger on it and the chart respond with a rising peak. 

Another one would be reading/writing text to that EEPROM (U2). It's "only" 256kb in 32768 words x 8-bits each. They come bigger, up to about 2Mb. It's enough to exercise memory allocation concepts. 

There's one that can blink LED lights, U4 is an I/O expander. That maybe should be increased to drive 7-segment displays and then numbers. The temperature read from the TMP100 sensor can be displayed.
