# Compare Pocket Computers:

How do you do this, comparing and picking the "best" pocket computer? Depends what you want to use it for.

The point of all this is data acquisition. We want to be able to collect real data in a university and/or industrial setting. 

Almost any microcontroller can read a temperature sensor these days. If you read once every second, that would be adequate sample rate.  

As acquisition speeds and resolutions increase however, the data through-put increases and then you start to need real processing power. Being able to compute or display results will require even more processing. 


- Beagle is 100% open source design. You don't get a Raspberry schematic, let alone the PCB design files. Of course, doing your own board isn't for the faint-hearted. 
- The new BeagleBone AI is a rocket at the expense of needing USB 3.0 to run tethered. 
- The older BeagleBone Black runs cool tethered on a USB 2.0.  
- The BeagleBone Black or AI can use the same "cape" plug-in board and are compatible, so far as the peripherals are common, which many of the standard issue ones are.
